Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

  I consulted with Nazifa and Maylynn. And we discussed how we completed certain parts of the code, our struggles and anxieities. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

     I attended Ab's monday office hours and TA hours on Tuesday at 7-9pm. Just hearing how other people viewed different aspects of the assignment and hearing the questions they asked helped me a lot when it came to understaing how to complete the assignment. I also used ChatGPT and W3schools only to explain step by step what each part required means and should do, this helped me understand the connections between each aspect of the skeleton code. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

    It seems like an interesting language that has some similaritites to Python. I think I would like it more if I knew the syntax of it more. I still very weary about it. Theere are a lot of aspects that still feel cloudy or unclear to me, especially since I was sick when we first started to dive into the coding. If you can explain the connection between attributes, methods, and classes again in class while coding an example that would be really helpful!

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

    I can say that programming is all about make connections and utilizing what you already know from previous experiences and languages to help you with your next task. And programming is not an ability where you learn everything and then you are able to implement it; it's more so, trial and error and asking for help in various ways. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    My biggest advice would be to go to office hours and try to become friends with the people who are either in your section or not but in class so that you all can work together because some assignments might be eaiser for you or others and working together helps relive some of the anxiety and helps you learn. 

    I kept getting that my scanner and transcript can't be resolved, this was because i wasn't using print transcript and input. 


    I'm still nervous about failing or asking for help but I will try my best to overcome these challenges.
